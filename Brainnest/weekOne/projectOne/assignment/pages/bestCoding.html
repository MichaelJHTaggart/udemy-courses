 <h1>Why I love to code</h1>
 <p>Ever since completing a bootcamp in 2021 I have been hungry for coding. I did a freelance website <a href="https://www.burlmountain.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">burlmountain</a>, and was interviewing like crazy. I was still finishing my associates degree (a 2 year college degree), and was looking for a part-time job. I found a job at the bootcamp I just attended. <a href="https://devmountain.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Devmountain</a> forced me to work with other young coders and solidify the basics while still finishing my degree. After a while I realized that each group that went through Devmountain made a Discord server to work together, and then it kind of fizzled out. So I decided that I wanted to create my own Discord server that I plan to maintain forever.</p>

 <h2>A place to work together</h2>
 <p>I wanted to create an environment of coders who could collaborate with other hungry coders who wanted to do cool stuff. Though I still haven't had the time to devote to a collab project yet on my server, I look forward to working with others to build fun projects!</p>

 <p><em><a href="https://discord.gg/ThbqMZfHzg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Here is an invite link to the server</a></em></p>

 <p>I love to code, because it gives me the freedom to build whatever I want to build! <strong>I can build amazing tools that can be used all around the world right here from my computer.</strong> That is what is so amazing about learning to code. The opportunities it opens up.</p>
